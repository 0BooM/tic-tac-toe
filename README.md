# tic-tac-toe

## Simple tic-tac-toe game to play with your friends. At the start of the game you can set your nicknames (they cannot be changed throughout the game).

This project was challenging because of the logic that had to be made. I wasn't able to finnish it all by me and myself but after googling some info I did it.
One thing that I'm not proud of is that I had to check one function in others repositories. I could use ChatGPT than looking at the answer, but at that moment my brain was about to explode :D.
I think that previous project about library was easier. I put into use factory functions and IIFE. Right now I find it easier to use than creating constructors and then NEW keyword before creating an object.
Like I said, the logic was easy to the point when I needed to check the winner so that was the thing that I looked up in someones repository. After all I think that it was because I was feeling low because right now it seems easy to implement. Maybe it will help me out in some of the future projects!
